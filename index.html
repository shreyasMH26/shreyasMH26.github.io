            <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Shreyas M H</strong>, also known as <strong>MH</strong> — a Computer Science Engineering student driven by curiosity, creativity, and the desire to build intelligent systems.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>I’m deeply passionate about <strong>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</strong>, and I love exploring how technology can learn, adapt, and solve real-world problems. For me, programming isn’t just about writing code — it’s about designing logic that feels alive and meaningful.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>I believe in learning through building. Every project, every bug, and every late-night idea teaches me something new about how humans and machines can grow together. My goal is to become an <strong>AI/ML engineer</strong> who creates impactful solutions that make technology more intuitive and human-centered.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>Beyond coding, I enjoy exploring ideas, experimenting with new tools, and continuously challenging myself to evolve — both as a developer and as a thinker.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>At my core, I’m someone who believes innovation begins with curiosity — and I’m here to turn that curiosity into creation.</p>
